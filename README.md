# PrisonerProblem
Simulation to solve yet another brainteaser

There are 100 prisoners in a jail, and a sadistic warden facing overcrowding issues decides to set up a game to let them try and win their freedom. The warden will fill up 100 drawers with little slips of papers corresponding to each prisoner's number. One by one, each prisoner is allowed to enter the room with these drawers and open 50 of them. Here's the catch

* If **all** the 100 prisoners successfully find their number amongst the 100 drawers on their turn in the room, then they are all allowed to go free.
* If **any** of the prisonsers fail, then they are all executed

The prisoners can't share information about the contents of the drawers, but they can all agree upon a single strategy to follow to try and save their skins.  This repo helps determine _what strategies the prisoners should use._
