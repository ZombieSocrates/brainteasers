# Brainteasers
Since I like solving probability-related brainteasers, here is a repository to contain all of that code-based work.

Each of the subdirectories here contains the code itself and further explanation of what exactly the problem is. Work in here so far:

* The Crazy Guy on the Plane problem
* The Prisoner Problem (_not the Prisoner's Dilemma_)
* Golden Birthday (TKTK)
